DISCO:
Tailwind:
You have to add the script within the head for tailwind using <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
You can add styling within tailwind using another script, an within it using tailwind.config to configure elements like theme, font, and colors.
Styling is defined through class="" instead of style="", and is generally a lot more streamlined and clearer to use, and also has more features. It somewhat resembles a more accessible and feature-full CSS.
Most importantly, you can set fonts with font-(font that you defined), margins (m-1, mt-2), and text size (text-xl).
A lot of elements use span html elements and include many classes from tailwind in their designs. 
Generally, Tailwind just allows you to have a more interactive and responsive website, like with the loading button.

QCC:
Tailwind:
How can we use animations better, like with integrating them directly into our website rather than using presets for things like the loading animation?

q0: 
Tailwind: 1

q0b: 
Tailwind:
We utilized the Tailwind documentation for the cursor loading effect on the buttons: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/cursor
We also utilized the same documentation for more information on margins, and for some smaller features that we chose to implement: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/margin

q1:
Andy: I think I prefer Bootstrap the most, since most of its details are a lot more immersive and I think it is genenerally a lot more developed, although it is slightly more confusing than Tailwind. Basically, if I was making a simple website, I would use Tailwind, but for more robust websites, I would use Bootstrap.
