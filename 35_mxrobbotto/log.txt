log.txt:

We had to tell copilot to put all the python text into just __init__.py, but it originally didn't work.
Copilot detects vulnerabilities, like unvalidated URL redirection and hardcoded credentials.
It also used a lot of imports that are unknown to us, like Bcrypt.
Copilot prefers to write code very neatly but also shortly, and doesn't like to blabber much unlike ChatGPT.
Code broke within the shell.
