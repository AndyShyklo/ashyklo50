DISCO:
* GET and POST are not required, but when specified, they are. They basically show the values of the person that is visiting, and what arguments come with that.
* A form will be able to add arguments and call actions when submitted.
* The username, when added, is now added to either the GET or POST variables, and displays itself in the url and is accessible via the parameters.
* The inputs for the form are shown as values in the url when accessing /auth, and you get a BadRequestKeyError if you do not have these parameters and just call /auth.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Q/C/C:
* Could anyone just add someone else's username into the top bar and access their account, displaying that person's info?
* What is the difference between GET and POST, and how is that shown here?
* How do you add more text areas and parameters to be viewed, and used. 
* How would I recognize a user and actually make the first method work as intended with breaking, as if it could access the username parameter right away.
