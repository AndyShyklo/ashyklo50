     trioTASK:
     If any member of team has forms experience, let their know-how OSMOTE.
     If no one does, seek external assistance.
     
     PROTIP: Revisit code from foundations if you have it.
     Peruse this code together and discuss how it should work,
       in conjunction with the back end apparatus.

Predictions:
Here, we will have a basic login type page on the screen, with an auth action on a form witht the option for username and a button to submit. 
When the submit button is pressed, the website redirects to /auth and displays the message on that page.   
-->
    <form action="/auth">
      <input type="text" name="username">
      <input type="submit" name="sub1">
    </form>
