     simple demo of HTML forms via Flask
     
     trioTASK:
     If any member of team has forms experience, let their know-how OSMOTE.
     If no one does, seek external assistance.
     
     PROTIP: Revisit code from foundations if you have it.
     Peruse this code together and discuss how it should work,
       in conjunction with the back end apparatus.

Predictions:
Here, we will have a basic login type page on the screen, with an auth action on a form witht the option for username and a button to submit. 
When the submit button is pressed, the website redirects to /auth and displays the message on that page.   
-->
    <form action="/auth">
      <input type="text" name="username">
      <!--Here, we see that the username argument and value is assigned to the text inputted there, which is used as an argument in the app.py. The submit box confirms
      this information and moves us to the auth page, displaying the username, which wasn't possible to access before the auth.-->
      <input type="submit" name="sub1">
    </form>
